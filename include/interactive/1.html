          <p>For more than 20 years the oil industry have tried to gain access to the areas off the coast of Lofoten, Vesterålen and Senja - Lovese in short. This is the last sea area in Norway which is still off limits for the oil industry.</p>
          <br />
          <p>In 2017 the temporary moratorium against oil drilling in the area expires. The same year a new government will be elected in the parliament elections. They will decide the future of these areas.</p>

          <p>The Standing Rock Sioux tribe has led the protest effort against the pipeline, a nearly 1,900km long pipeline that will transport 470,000 barrels of crude oil a day across four states. Obama halted the work on the pipeline, but Trump signed executive orders to allow the construction to go forth.</p>

          <p>Keystone XL is a proposed tar sands pipeline that would  would carry 800,000 barrels per day of tar sands oil across the United States to be refined, exported and burned.Tar sands oil has a massive carbon footprint — sometimes requiring more energy to produce than it creates — and Keystone XL is the key to making burning that oil economically feasible.Obama initially stopped the project, but Trump signed executive orders to allow construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.</p>

          <p>In 2015 Shell abandoned its controversial drilling operations in the Alaskan Arctic in the face of mounting opposition in what jubilant environmentalists described as “an unmitigated defeat” for big oil.</p>

          <p>LeardBlockade is the first coal mine blockade camp in Australia. The #LeardBlockade started 5 August 2012 in the Leard State Forest. Front Line Action on Coal is committed to community led, non-violent direct action. The #LeardBlockade aims to protect farms, forest, community, culture and the climate from Whitehaven Coal’s proposed Maules Creek mine and other coal mining operations in the Leard State Forest.</p>

          <p>BP are pushing to drill the Great Australian Bight. They will be the first of a wave of oil companies looking to expand the fossil fuel industry into the Bight, placing the pristine marine environment at risk. The Great Australian Bight is home to a unique and extraordinary array of marine life.  Whales, sea lions, birds, turtles, fish and sponge gardens all depend on its pristine waters.  The indigenous people of the Nullarbor and Western Eyre Peninsula have been its custodians for tens of thousands of years - and remain so today.</p>
