          <p>Across the world, local communities are fighting to stop new coal, oil and gas projects. Our common future is being decided on these carbon battlegrounds. This is the story about one of those battlegrounds. </p>

          <p>For more than 20 years the oil industry have tried to gain access to the areas off the coast of Lofoten, Vesterålen and Senja - Lovese in short. This is the last sea area in Norway which is still off limits for the oil industry. </p>

          <p>The areas of Lofoten, Vesterålen and Senja have a fantastic natural environment and invaluable ecosystems. Here, the world’s last large stock of cod spawns and one of Europe’s biggest nesting sites caters for a wide array of seabirds. This same area is home to whales such as orcas, humpback whales and sperm whales and if you dive deep enough you’ll find the world’s largest coldwater coral reef. This ecological richness has been the basis for settlement in these coastal areas for more than 1000 years. </p>

          <p>In 2017 the temporary moratorium against oil drilling in the area expires. The same year a new government will be elected in the parliament elections. They will decide the future of these areas. Help us make sure they keep them safe for generations to come.</p>

          <p>This interactive documentary explores the issue through the people who lives in the area. By using film, contextual 360&#176; imagery and data visualizations we are making this issue accessible for a larger audience. The project has been developed by a small team of designers, developers and photographers.

  				<p>We have teamed up with the following organizations to be able to make this project come true.</p>

  				<h4>Folkeaksjonen</h4>
  				<p>A nationwide, member based organization which has been working to keep the areas protected against the oil industry since 2009.</p>

  				<h4>Friends of the Earth Norway</h4>
  				<p>Friends of the Earth Norway is Norway's oldest environmental and nature protection organisation and has more than 20 000 members.</p>
